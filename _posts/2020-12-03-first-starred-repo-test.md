I was talking with a colleague about how I used cookiecutter to create a project template and showed him the [repo](https://github.com/Wahe3bru/DataScienceTeamProjectTemplate) in action.

I remember us having a chat during my interview and me explaining it to him. I have a suspicion that that was what got me the job ;)

One of the biggest problems in the team was the rapid development of the datalake and the constant changes to the development and production environment. Now that the prod environment is maturing and is stable, the development packs are being fined tuned and the problem arises when developers clone previous similar projects and modify it.

So as a side project we are working on developing a project template that can be hosted in the team repo that can be updated centrally, and everyone can just pull the latest template.

This solves two things;  
i) the devs clone previous projects to save time, instead of collecting disparate pieces into the project.  
ii) There is a standard project template which can be updated easily by the head developer.

It's been awhile since I looked at my cookiecutter template and I realised that since being pushed and now, someone has found it interesting/useful enough to give it a star!

This is my first repo that was actually created with the intention for others to use. Hence the well thought out [readme](https://github.com/Wahe3bru/DataScienceTeamProjectTemplate).  
Looking through my github you'll see that most repos are either interesting projects that I would like to learn from, or projects that I am working on (or was working on) to practice what I am learning. I have previously worked on a collaborative project and submitted 3 pull requests to open source projects before, but now I have a personal project that was shared to the interwebs... and someone in the other side of the world (China) liked it.  

So special thanks to [vtecftwy](https://github.com/vtecftwy) for making my day!
